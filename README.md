# dwm-fancybarclickable-6.1
This patch is different from the original [fancybarclickable](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fancybarclickable/). I removed the drawline and [monocle count](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/monocle_count/). It much resembles the [fancybar](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fancybar/) but clickable.
